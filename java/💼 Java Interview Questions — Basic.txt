💼 Java Interview Q&A for Beginners
🟩 1. Introduction & Basics

1. What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

2. Features of Java:
Simple, Object-Oriented, Platform-Independent, Secure, Robust, Portable, Multithreaded.

3. Why is Java platform independent?
Because Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) on any platform.

4. What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?

JVM: Executes Java bytecode.

JRE: JVM + Libraries → runs Java programs.

JDK: JRE + Development tools → to develop Java programs.

5. What is bytecode?
Intermediate code generated after compilation of a Java program; executed by the JVM.

6. Compiler vs Interpreter:

Compiler translates the whole code at once.

Interpreter executes line-by-line.
(Java uses both.)

7. Why is Java called OOP?
Because it uses classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

8. What are identifiers?
Names given to variables, classes, methods, etc.

9. What are keywords?
Reserved words in Java (e.g. class, int, if, static).

10. Difference between JDK, JRE, JVM:

Term	Function
JVM	Executes code
JRE	Runs code
JDK	Develops code
🟦 2. Data Types & Variables

11. Data types in Java:

Primitive: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

Non-Primitive: String, Arrays, Classes

12. Default values:
int=0, float=0.0, boolean=false, char=‘\u0000’

13. Types of variables:
Local, Instance, Static.

14. Static vs Non-Static:
Static belongs to class; non-static belongs to object.

15. Type casting:
Converting one data type to another.
Example:

int a = 10;
double b = a; // widening


16. Widening vs Narrowing:

Widening: smaller → larger type (automatic)

Narrowing: larger → smaller type (manual)

🟨 3. Operators & Expressions

17. Types of operators:
Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise, Unary, Ternary.

18. Difference between == and equals():

== compares references.

equals() compares values.

19. Difference between && and &:

&& → short-circuit AND

& → bitwise AND

20. Ternary operator:
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

21. Pre vs Post Increment:

++a increases first.

a++ increases after use.

🟪 4. Control Statements

22. Control statements:
if, if-else, switch, for, while, do-while, break, continue.

23. If-else examples:

if(a>0)
  System.out.println("Positive");
else
  System.out.println("Negative");


24. Switch statement:
Used to test multiple conditions.

switch(day) {
 case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
 default: System.out.println("Invalid");
}


25. while vs do-while:
while checks before; do-while checks after execution.

26. For loop:
Used when number of iterations is known.

for(int i=1;i<=5;i++)
  System.out.println(i);


27. break vs continue:

break → exits loop

continue → skips current iteration

🟧 5. OOPs Concepts

28. Class:
Blueprint for creating objects.

29. Object:
Instance of a class containing data and behavior.

30. Class vs Object:
Class = design; Object = real entity.

31. Inheritance:
Process where one class acquires properties of another using extends.

32. Types of inheritance in Java:
Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical (not multiple via classes).

33. Polymorphism:
Same function name with different behaviors.

34. Method overloading vs overriding:

Overloading → same name, different parameters (compile-time).

Overriding → same name, same parameters in subclass (run-time).

35. Encapsulation:
Wrapping data & code together (using private variables + getters/setters).

36. Abstraction:
Hiding implementation details; showing only essential info.

37. Abstract class vs Interface:

Abstract Class	Interface
Can have concrete & abstract methods	Only abstract methods (Java 7)
Uses extends	Uses implements

38. Can we create object of abstract class?
No.

39. Constructor:
Used to initialize objects; same name as class.

40. Constructor vs Method:

Constructor	Method
No return type	Has return type
Called automatically	Called manually
🟥 6. Arrays & Strings

41. Array:
Collection of similar type elements.

42. Declaration & Initialization:

int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5};


43. Default array value:
Numeric = 0, Boolean = false, Object = null.

44. One-D vs Multi-D:
One row vs multiple rows (2D array = matrix).

45. String:
Sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

46. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer:

Class	Mutability	Thread Safe
String	Immutable	Yes
StringBuilder	Mutable	No
StringBuffer	Mutable	Yes
🟫 7. Exception Handling

47. Exception Handling:
Mechanism to handle runtime errors.

48. Types:
Checked (compile-time) and Unchecked (runtime).

49. Checked vs Unchecked:

Checked → must be handled (IOException).

Unchecked → optional (ArithmeticException).

50. try-catch-finally:
Used to handle exceptions safely.

try {
 int a = 10/0;
} catch(Exception e) {
 System.out.println(e);
} finally {
 System.out.println("Always runs");
}


51. throw vs throws:

throw → used to throw an exception manually.

throws → declares exceptions.

⚙️ 8. Miscellaneous

52. this keyword:
Refers to current object.

53. super keyword:
Refers to parent class variable or method.

54. static method:
Belongs to class, not object.

55. Can we override static methods?
No.

56. final, finally, finalize():

Keyword	Use
final	constant/prevent inheritance
finally	cleanup block
finalize()	called before garbage collection

57. Package:
Group of related classes.

58. import statements:

import java.util.*; → imports all classes.

import java.util.Scanner; → imports only Scanner.

59. Access Modifiers:
public, private, protected, default.

60. Garbage Collection:
Automatic memory management done by JVM.
